desc: "This package contains the HttpPipelinePolicy interface and its implementations. These policies are used to form an HTTP pipeline, which is a series of policies that are invoked to handle an HTTP request.\n\nThe HttpPipelinePolicy interface defines process and processSync methods. These methods transform an HTTP request into an HttpResponse asynchronously and synchronously respectively. Implementations of this interface can modify the request, pass it to the next policy, and then modify the response.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n\nIn this example, the UserAgentPolicy, RetryPolicy, and CustomPolicy are added to the pipeline. The pipeline is then used to send an HTTP request, and the response is retrieved.\n\n```java\nHttpPipeline pipeline = new HttpPipelineBuilder()\n     .policies(new UserAgentPolicy(), new RetryPolicy(), new CustomPolicy())\n     .build();\n\n HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest(HttpMethod.GET, new URL(\"http://example.com\"));\n Response response = pipeline.send(request).block();\n```\n\nThis package is crucial for the communication between Azure SDK client libraries and Azure services. It provides a layer of abstraction over the HTTP protocol, allowing client libraries to focus on service-specific logic."
